*[Sung Kim](https://github.com/hunkim), learning Computer Science in HKUST, makes great lectures for machine learning beginners to teach ML basic ideas and how to use Tensorflow. I keep practicing to make some machine learning models using TF. All of these video clips and codes are authorized by Sung Kim. Enjoy studying machine learning!*
